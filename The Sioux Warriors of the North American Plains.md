before colonization took a hold across
the north american territories in the
15th century a.d various tribal
civilizations existed across the
beautiful continental landscape from the
swamps in the south to the woodland
hills in the east to the plains in the
midwest and to the mountains in the
central and the deserts in the west
indigenous folk of a pre-columbus
america dominated the countryside
without even a thought of white settlers
beckoning to explore their land in the
centuries to come
these tribes weren't simply barbaric
masses of savages and killers but rather
complex societies featuring thousands of
languages and dialects cultures with
passionate obligations political systems
and leadership councils and religions
saturated with spiritualism and
mythology
unfortunately however a majority of
these customs and beliefs were nearly
wiped completely from the history books
after the introduction of colonization
in america in the 16th century which saw
the number of native american
populations decreased by hundreds of
thousands
only microscopic portions of these
tribes make up american demographics in
the present day
in order to preserve their histories
cultures and ways of life this is the
first in a series of brief essays
documenting the rich details of native
american tribes ranging from the first
nations in canada to the natives
mexicanos in mexico
this is the first story of the seven
council fires colloquially known as the
sioux

with roots in america dating back to 100
to 400 a.d the sioux were and still are
one of the largest nations of indigenous
americans in all of history
members of the sioux themselves call
themselves the great sioux nation
translated to seven council fires in
english
the fires represent the seven or yate
translated to nations or peoples
presently these nations include the
teton or lakota
a collective of four tribes called the
santee or eastern dakota and the
collective of two tribes called the
yangthun
or western dakota
most modern-day non-native scholars
refer to these nations simply as the
lakota or dakota all dependent on the
intricate dialect changes between
specific tribes
these languages are called the soon
catawba and were spoken by various
tribes ranging from the modern day
carolinas up into western canada
one of the few dialect similarities
throughout all tribes are the words
lakota and dakota which translates to
ally when spoken by different members of
different nations to one another
in the 1760s french colonizers
attributed the word sioux to the seven
council fires an abbreviation of the
french word narasu attributed to the
native tribes by a colonist of the name
jean-nicolet in 1640.
the word is a combination of the ojibwe
word for little snake narusi and an
incorrectly used suffix by french
colonizers
today the people of seven council fires
are referred to in ojibwe as
translated to roasters in english most
likely affiliated with the means of
cooking used by the tribes of yesteryear
other modern day nations have legally
changed their colonial names back to
traditional names whereas some have
foregone the legal system in total and
reject the usage of romance language
derived names in general
in terms of traditional structures of
society seen in various tribes the seven
council fires feature a unique
combination of family ties natural
connection and both earthly and cosmic
spiritualism
many of the villages held what the
english call camp circles ceremonies
promoting kinship and community and
members considered themselves a large
extended family consisting of smaller
immediate families
no two camp circles were alike either
and all ceremonies were guided by an
appointed leader chosen by a council
filled with elder statesmen from the
tribe
the vitality of kinship was not limited
to camp circles and family dynamics
however
proper kinship was a requirement of all
tribal members extending from childhood
to elderhood this included being a
proper relative friend and leader
it also included all living subjects on
earth as well as all parts of the
natural world
to put something before kinship such as
material riches or personal glory would
be to go against the strongest values
each tribe maintained
these ideals carried over even into
other eras of colonization
members of the seven council fires were
not obstinate to trade with white
settlers for no reason rather they
carried a deeply spiritual requirement
to form a bond with all whom they traded
with including their invaders
some early colonists fell in line with
these indigenous customs and fostered
such special bonds with tribal members
and they were adopted into the band as
outsiders
of course these instances were few and
far between as most of the colonists
were too stubborn or impatient to form
social bonds with any native american
regardless of tribe and falsely
attributed the customs to ego
pride and narcissism
there was also a tightly woven system of
religions within the seven council fires
as well
the overarching belief was that the
cosmos and everything in it was created
by a being called the great spirit or
the great mystery when translated to
english
the symbol of these beliefs came in the
form of a sacred hoop as english
translations have it also called
medicine circles and other various
indigenous dialects
the visual is meant to invoke the sense
of oneness throughout the universe all
held together by the great spirit
this included the concept of all things
the trees and the hillsides to the lakes
and the riverbeds to the birds and
various creatures crawling across the
planet were all equal in spirit but
still below the status of the great
mystery
connecting tribal members to the spirits
on the ground and in the sky was a type
of prayer and it translated to claiming
a relationship with when spoken in
english
in the lakota nations a prophet called
white buffalo calf woman was sent to
earth to act as a medium between the
great spirit and the human race
through this relationship the prophet
taught humans how to establish proper
kinship and be a great member of the
family through a series of ceremonies
called the seven sacred rites
these rites ranged from purification to
a sundance to vision quests to female
puberty celebrations all seven rites
were then confirmed via the smoking of a
sacred pipe in which all elements of the
ritual represented the elements of earth
and the connections between them and
humankind
[Music]
dreams are also incredibly important
tools used by the seven council fires to
establish their connections with the
spiritual world and enhance their
abilities on an earthly realm
one such example was the instruction
that dreaming of thunder beings when
translated to english would turn the
dreamer into a sacred jester who would
then share their supernatural power with
all who encountered them and their
comedic performances
funeral practices were also hugely
symbolic and spiritual rights performed
by tribal members all throughout their
history
traditionally tribes would honor the
deceased with a four day wake in which
all members of the band mourned and
guided the dead spirit into the earthly
resting place
tribal members would also put the corpse
of the deceased on a burial scaffold
either in the trees or on a vertical
pole to keep the body off the ground
the body would remain there for a year
with offerings put on the head and cloth
wrapped around the rest the deceased
were not strayed away from or kept
private however
tribes would continue to speak to the
bodies of the dead even offering them
food or drink
this was all part of the process of
guiding the deceased along its spiritual
journey and allowing the rest of the
tribe to properly mourn whilst also
gaining newfound connections with a
spiritual realm
of course no tribe of the seven council
fires was complete without an assortment
of musical styles permeating around
villages and campsites
various tribes amongst the dakota bands
utilized a call-in response style of
song and dance
led by a solo vocalist who starts
singing in a high pitch before
transitioning to a specific phrase
the rest of the group then repeats this
phrase continuing to lower their pitch
before stopping all together with an
effective pause
in the second half of the arrangement
performers will create sounds called
honor beats
honor beats usually consisted of four
steady beats symbolizing the low
frequency sounds of war impending
conflict and later the sound of cannon
fire after the colonization of america
by europeans brought over
artillery-based warfare
the dakota tribes also utilized
percussion in their song and dance
rituals
these bands especially practice
syncopation which is the rhythmic
beating of drums or other percussive
surfaces to form an entire song
this could either be offbeat drumming
synchronized drumming or most often a
combination of the two
some bands within the same tribe would
engage in competitive musicianship with
songs that evolved from non-pattern
ruffles to a patterned fast-paced beat
in all dakota-based tribal events
nothing could start until the dakota
flag song is played
this custom includes no dance but is a
pillar of pow-wows and celebrations of
the warriors amongst each tribe
across all musician customs of the seven
council fires lyrical songs were few and
far between with most music only using
syllabic sounds vocables and guttural
noises without a translation
sometimes lyrics would be included but
only in the second half of performances
women were also heavily utilized in song
and dance rituals normally singing at a
higher pitch and carrying musical
performances the second and third time
through the song or as many times as the
piece is repeated
every summer these types of large
communal performances were key pieces of
the main assembly of all leaders across
all seven tribes where tribal figures
came together to restore their kinship
values and deliberate on tribal ordeals
at the summer festivities four main
tribal leaders were appointed by the
heads of each band in the tribes
depending on the nominee's intelligence
compassion
courage and resiliency
this was the highest honor bestowed upon
the seven council fires and one was only
chosen if the rest of the leadership
believed this member to be able to carry
on all of the tribes traditions and
maintain their desired day-to-day lives
responsibilities of the four leaders
included making decisions on replotting
camps and villages navigating conflict
between neighboring tribes and planning
large-scale tribal hunts
below the sub-leadership were
collections of fraternities of men split
into two factions of younger males and
older males
each faction had their own
responsibilities and the former leaders
and various elders in the older age
group helped guide their youthful
counterparts
seven council fires also included entire
societies of warrior bands who were
tasked with leading hunts training for
battle and providing security to the
rest of the village or community
alongside these warrior arms were two
elected voices of the communities called
shirt wearers when translated to english
shirt wearers were master communicators
and peer mediators tasked with settling
disputes both within tribal bands and
with foreign parties such as the
colonizers in the 16th century
almost all shirt wearers were men and
had to display qualities of future
leadership whilst also coming from a
bloodline of former leaders as well
ranked right below the shirt wearers
were pipe holders
pipe holders were vital to ceremonial
rituals seen across tribes as they
guided peace talks within the ceremonies
and made sure everyone involved had
exactly what they needed
pipe holders also helped the top leaders
select potential campsites and village
movement as well as watching over the
warrior bands whenever they would
venture out on buffalo hunts
men weren't the only ones with
responsibilities however
while there were defined gender roles
across the seven council fires like many
traditional eastern cultures
women didn't do chores around the house
they did help make cloth and weave
fabric but they also were considered
owners of the houses themselves
responsible for all decisions pertaining
to a residence
men and women also were not restricted
to certain sexual preferences or
intimate relationships either even
gender itself was seen as a fluid
identity and tribal members assigned
male at birth would sometimes take on
the duties of those assigned female at
birth and vice versa without judgment or
scorn being passed on by elders or other
members of a tribe
overall the seven council fires saw
themselves as a unique yet fundamental
piece to the planet's ecosystem whilst
understanding the bond we form with each
other and every other living thing on
earth is vital to a fulfilling and
proper life

the ancestors of modern day seven
council fires are first thought to have
arrived in what is present-day
northwestern wisconsin and central
minnesota back around 800 a.d
they came from the central mississippi
river valley living there for at least a
couple of millennia
these indigenous bands are now called
the woodland blackduck cathedral clam
river continuum by english historians of
modern age
the continuum didn't acquire the
cultures and customs seen in northern
tribal communities until 1300 a.d of
which they acquired from fellow tribes
in the region
it was around this time that the period
of the continuum officially became the
period of seven council fires
over the next 300 years the seven
council fires developed into what we
best consider the sioux native american
branch as they were met by european
colonists in the 16th and 17th centuries
that is until the 1650s when the area
once inhabited by the seven council
fires around the source of the
mississippi river and the great lakes
region in general was under a claims
dispute by the iroquois tribe of the
first nations
the iroquois were long-time rivals to
the seven council fires and the two
tribes engaged in elongated warfare just
as the fur traders from europe arrived
thus by 1659 the dakota tribes moved
west into wisconsin and minnesota and by
1700 nearly all tribal members called
this region their home
meanwhile the lakota tribes started
pushing their villages westward into the
great plains and most of the seven
council fires ended up with them
with the westward expansion of
indigenous folks however came along the
westward expansion of colonists and
pioneers currently colonizing america
these white settlers of course mingled
with the seven council fires in both the
east and northern midwest territories
and introduced the horses to the tribes
by the 18th century
[Music]
despite the acquisitions of horses a
newfound approach to transportation the
dakota tribes in present-day wisconsin
and minnesota were unable to hold their
eastward borders due to the constant
encroachment of the iroquois and other
inter-tribal contestants
the seven council fires also started
dealing with massive outbreaks of
smallpox and malaria due to the arrival
of colonists and saw their numbers
deteriorate by over 30 percent by 1805
and the tribes still occupying the great
lakes regions
around the same time the surviving
decoded tribes to the north and the
lakota tribes to the east began fur
trading with the french
these practices date back into the 17th
century when the iroquois first pushed
the seven council fires west
while the relationships the lakota and
dakota built with the french were mostly
docile as long as the colonizers
understood the vitality and importance
of kinship their history of trading
wasn't without conflict
seven council fires had more than a few
conflicts with other tribes around the
territories and those rival tribes saw
the french's involvement with the sioux
as encroachment on their peace
these tribes included the ojibwe decree
and the mesquaki
after the turn of the 19th century as
the seven council fires remnants pushed
further into the great plains regions of
america they began to adopt customs and
traits of the indigenous groups that had
once called the plains their homes for
years
by 1803 the three major bands of the
western dakota eastern dakota and lakota
were all incredibly distinct in their
practices and customs but still held
their sacred bond of kinship which kept
the tribes connected well beyond their
geographical developments
unfortunately it was around this time
that the seven council fires truly began
to feel the disastrous effects
colonization has on their lands and on
their people
in 1825 they were forced into the treaty
of prairie du chien with seven other
indigenous tribes in an effort to stop
inter-tribal warfare all for the sake of
the settlers
then five years later they were forced
into another treaty of the same name in
1830 in which the lakota had to give up
their lands found near the des moines
river to the united states government
in 1849 with the birth of the minnesota
territory more siouxlands were forcibly
taken by the american leadership after
they entered various contracts insuring
the tribe's millions of us dollars after
they had sold 21 million acres for 1.6
million dollars
yet in an unsurprising twist nearly 80
percent of this money was kept by the
american government and more and more
lands were stolen without proper notice
by 1858 the first ever seven council
fires reservation was created in charles
mick's county of present-day south
dakota
the reservation consists of less than
only 37 000 acres but it was the event
that led to various tribal leaders
across all seven council fires to speak
out against the colonizers and affirm
the desire to defend their homeland and
fight back
the fighting truly began in 1862 with
the dakota war stemming from the starved
tribes whose nomadic hunting efforts
were completely thwarted by white
settlers
the colonizers wanted the tribes to hunt
more like europeans and settle down as
farmers but the seven council fires saw
this as a threat to their way of life
and resisted
the conflicts lasted all the way until
december 26 1862 when 38 members of the
dakota tribe were lynched in mankato
under the guise of the united states
government and the remaining tribal
members were pushed out of minnesota for
good
the remaining dakota bans split off to
the reservations popping up throughout
the north dakota regions south dakota
regions great plains regions or they
moved west with a migrated lakota branch
the lakota had already entered a land
agreement with the us government in 1851
with the fort laramie treaty
the contract was between nine separate
indigenous tribes who all agreed to stop
inter-tribal conflict and allow for the
safe passage of white settlers who are
at that point engaging with the wagon
trails and migrating to oregon territory
however that treaty was swiftly broken
just as quickly as it had been agreed to
the lakota engaged in multiple scuffles
with the crow tribes and with the
uncontrolled influx of unruly settlers
in the late 1850s as a result of pike's
peak gold rush in colorado indigenous
affairs quickly grew intolerable to
their new neighbors
another similar treaty to fort laramie
was attempted a few years later in 1868
but again did little to mitigate the
inter-tribal warfare as the american
systematic destruction of the american
buffalo which was the basic food and
clothing source for most indigenous
tribes in the western united states
ravaged the seven council fires with
famine fatigue and inflamed frustrations
when the black hills gold rush saw an
influx of colonists settle along the
northern great plains of modern day
south dakota and wyoming the 1868 treaty
was all but rendered dead once george
armstrong custer brought an expansive
expedition force into the area in 1874
and disrespected the indigenous bands
already living in the area the seven
council fires and neighboring northern
chippewa tribes had enough and the great
sioux war was underway in two short
years in 1876
the great sioux war of 1876 was prefaced
with various raids and smaller conflicts
between the seven council fires and both
settlers and opposing tribes since the
1850s
many of the battles were over the
effects from the buffalo extinctions and
land disputes comprising the generalized
sioux wars from 1850 to 1890
these conflicts ranged from the dakota
war of 1862 and red cloud's war to the
black hills war and the battle of the
little bighorn from 1876 to 1877.
the great sioux war of 1876 was
specifically about the us government's
lackadaisical approach to keeping
settlers out of the black hills which
had belonged to the two tribes claiming
it for hundreds of years
the united states went to war led by the
aforementioned lieutenant colonel george
armstrong custer whereas the chippewa
arapaho and seven council fires were led
by crazy horse chief gaul and sitting
bull
throughout the conflict the united
states army systematically sectioned off
vital resources to the indigenous tribes
in each swath of land they claimed
eventually the tribes were without
choice but to make one final push
[Music]
the final conflict of the 40-year series
of wars is colloquially known as the
wounded knee massacre on december 29
1890
the name is derived from the nearby
wounded knee creek on the lakota pine
ridge native american reservation where
almost 150 men women and children of a
lakota tribe were mercilessly
slaughtered by the u.s army
another 150 lakota tribesmen escaped
from the ordeal and fled into the
countryside however it being the onset
of winter most of if not all of the
fleeing members died of hypothermia and
other natural elements due to the
incoming blizzard
the massacre at wound and knee was seen
as a pivotal point in the seven council
fires history from this point forward
all tribes were subject to the
assimilation of native americans into
the colonized united states
the assimilation era was marked with
various reservations and boarding
schools being erected so that the tribal
members would still have a stake to
claim on their homeland
however as is seen across all histories
of all tribes to the first nations and
indigenous americans these reservations
were marked with inhumane conditions and
the boarding schools were simply vessels
of cultural and spiritual deconstruction
children were forced to adapt to
christian principles and european
traditions which eventually became
american traditions as the rest of the
country was colonized and all tribal
nations across the continent were
subjected to partial if any sovereignty
these methods of assimilation lasted all
the way into the 1980s when efforts for
self-determination swirled through the
remaining community members considered
members of the seven council fires
in modern times the seven council fires
have focused on reclaiming sovereignty
in their lands
in 1980 they were awarded 100 million
dollars in reparations for the theft of
the black hills region in the 1870s
however the tribe has since refused as
there is no monetary comparison for
their ancestors home
the deal is currently worth upwards of
one billion dollars in reparations with
zero expectation that they will ever be
collected
there's also the present day issue of
the dakota access oil pipeline
in 2016 a group of seven council fires
members successfully protested the
drilling of the bakken pipeline of the
bakken oil fields which are found on the
standing rock sioux reservation
the pipeline would have introduced a
bevy of environmental issues such as
toxifying drinking water and destroying
the little cultural relationship the
tribal members maintained with the earth
as of today the pipeline is still under
construction despite these protests and
the written solidarity of 87 other
tribal leaders who also reject the
project's premise
all in all the total population of the
seven council fires sits at just 170 000
as of the 2010 census just a fraction of
the numbers the tribes saw 200 plus
years ago
significant populations currently reside
in both north and south dakota minnesota
nebraska montana wisconsin illinois and
wyoming as well as the manitoba and
saskatchewan provinces and canada
it's easy to think of the sioux and only
attribute them to the conflicts along
the american frontier during the wild
west's heyday in the mid to late 19th
century but it's important to remember
their histories and cultures date back
centuries before
instead think of the seven council fires
as a network of close-knit communities
bonded to each other into the natural
world around them through a dedicated
focus on kinship
think of them as environmentalists
dedicating their lives to enhancing
humankind's relationship with earth
think of them as expert buffalo hunters
and agile warriors
think of them as dreamers and
spiritualists as musicians and
storytellers with a deep-rooted love in
friendship family
and humanity
this is the story of the seven council
fires
