northern Great Plains until the
occupation of these lands by the
expanding United States Empire borne
over thousands of years our sacred way

qualities that endure in our survival
today as we move beyond seven

generations in our unyielding struggle
to resist genocide our matriarchal
grandmother's are taking back their
strength once again and togetherness
with Lakota warriors and people we speak
out for accountability and change to end
the atrocities that keep us from healing
our nation's only by understanding our

we did not ask you white men to come
here we do not want your civilization we
would live as our fathers did and their
fathers before them in 1492 the

indigenous Arawak people of the
Caribbean islands encountered
Christopher Columbus of Spain Columbus
wrote in his log they would make fine
servants with 50 men we could subjugate
them all and make them do whatever we
want
Columbus proceeded to unleash a reign of
terror on like anything seen before when
he was finished eight million arrow acts
virtually the entire native population
of Hispaniola had been exterminated by
torture murder forced labor starvation
disease and despair Columbus's
atrocities with cross and sword were
justified by the Christian doctrine of
divine discovery and sent religious and
legal precedent for the invasion and
genocide of America's indigenous peoples
for the next five hundred years and
beyond by 1650 a precarious relationship

between the first nations of the east
coast of North America and New England
colonists was collapsing into slaughter
and enslavement of native people by
Sevres who wanted more land and wealth
we find that most of the English
colonies sanctioned and encouraged
scalping Indians in 1776 the United
States Burke the first 13 states on land
taken through the ethnic cleansing of
dozens of eastern seaboard tribes the
Declaration of Independence further
enshrined the belief of ural American
settler supremacy by declaring native
peoples to be merciless Indian savages
in 1787 the United States adopted its

constitution article 6 established
treaties as a supreme law of the land
despite this supreme law treaties which
govern Native Nations became slippery
promises easily broken when convenient
[Music]
in 1823 in the case of Johnson and
Graham resi Dean McIntosh the Supreme
Court of the United States ruled that
the First Nation people's right of
occupancy was subordinate to the United
States divine right of discovery the
United States has unequivocally agreed
that discovery gave an exclusive right
to extinguish the Indian title of
occupancy this landmark ruling provided
legal cover for governmental policies
that would claim white euro Christian
supremacy as justification for stealing
indigenous lands and for the genocide of
native peoples in 18-49 the California
Gold Rush triggered the mass Western
migration of settlers putting them in
direct conflict with existing digital
nations in 1851 anxious to protect white

settlers on their way to California and
to avoid a full-scale war with the
Lakota and our allies the United States
requested the Treaty of Fort Laramie
with the Sioux and other northern Great
Plains nations six two men signed the
treaty which recognized the Lakota
nations sovereignty over a vast
territory amounting to approximately
five percent of the continental United
States with the end of the Civil War in
1865 the United States that it's war
hardened soldiers on the crusade to
settle the West led by the growing dogma
of manifest destiny the u.s. claims a
god-given right to expand its borders
from sea to shining sea dam and a man

who sympathizes with Indians I have come
to kill Indians to believe it as right
and honorable to use any means under
God's heaven to kill them in 1868 unable
to defeat the Warriors of the Sioux
Cheyenne and Arapaho nations fighting to
protect our lands and people for the
first time in assist me the United
States appealed for treats and drafted
the second Treaty of Fort Laramie
the treaty established the Great Sioux
Reservation including the Black Hills
and unseeded Indian Territory to be set
apart for the absolute and undisturbed
use and occupation of the Indians and
that no white person or persons shall be
permitted to settle upon or occupy any
portion of the Indian Territory unable
to defeat our free Lakota people with
military might the u.s. government
increased the use of deceptive practices
to subvert our matriarchal system and to
create the appearance of agreements when
our lands and rights were stolen it is
my purpose to utterly exterminate the
Sioux they are to be treated as maniacs
or wild beasts and by no means as people
with some treaties or compromise can be
made just three years later in 1871 the
US government seeks to recognize Indian
nations to sovereign and independent
with the passage of the Indian
appropriation act this legislation
legalized the theft of our treaty
protected lands and Berthe threatened
our way of life with our Buffalo
relatives the civilization of the
Indians isn't possible while the Buffalo
remained upon the plains the mass
slaughter of our Buffalo relatives the
two takoyaki lasted from 1871 until 1910

in just the first seven years buffalo
hunters decimated the great herds of
Buffalo
nearly to extinction the US Army
encouraged the slaughter by providing
free ammunition and supplies

in 1873 alone buffalo hunters massacred
more than 1.5 million Buffalo as planned

our people became increasingly dependent
on the US government for even the most
basic of human needs like food clothing
and shelter in 1874 after illegally

trespassing on Lakota territory General
George Custer publicly announced the
discovery of gold in the paja Sabha the
Black Hills as intended the announcement
unleashed a flood of miners and
prospectors into the Great Sioux
Reservation in violation of the 1868
treaty in 1875 the u.s. demanded we sell

the entire Black Hills region we refused
the u.s. declared this an act of war and
launched a massive invasion of our land
to annihilate our people nothing short
of their annihilation will get the Black
Hills from them on the 25th of June 1876
in the Battle of the greasy grass or
Little Bighorn the Sioux Nation along
with our Cheyenne and Arapaho relatives
won a great victory over General Custer
and the elite 7th Calvary on that day we
defeated the might of the US Army and
took their flag seeking revenge for
their defeat the US Army directed
Colonel rattled Mackenzie to unleash
total war US forces went from village to
village killing women children and
ponies and destroying teepees clothing
blankets and food supplies the US then
launched the cell forced our policy and
withheld rations to cohurt our people to
sell the Black Hills and to relinquish
our sovereign rights these inhuman
atrocities forced the surrender of many
Lakota people to the US agencies by
spring of 1877 despite being on the
brink of starvation few of our people
signed the agreement to see
the black hills when the paper was
signed by Red Cloud spotted tail and
others to give up the Black Hills the
majority of the Indians of the Teton
Sioux tribe were not there and they
never consented to giving up the Black
Hills and never gave those Chiefs
permission or authority to sell or give
up the black hills unable to obtain the
required three-fourths consent the u.s.
sees the Black Hills of an act of
Congress in violation of the 1868 Treaty
of Fort Laramie consent by the illegal
seizure negotiator for the u.s. Henry
Benjamin Whipple wrote I know of no
other instance in history where a great
nation has so shamefully violated it so
our country must forever bear the
disgrace and suffer the retribution of
its wrongdoings our children's children
will tell the sad stories in hushed
tones and wonder how their fathers dead
so to trample on justice and trifle with
God after breaking trees ceasing native

lands and destroying our system of life
the US government introduced another
element of the genocide of turtle
islands and ditches people assimilation

kill the Indian save the man in the
1880s the US government joined forces
with Christian and Catholic missionaries
to steal native children as young as two
years old and their families ship them
to schools far away burn their clothes
and cut their hair deprive them of
loving family contact for years and use
mental and physical abuse to force their
assimilation into American society and
the Christian religion there are but two

goals for the Indians civilization or
annihilation in 1883 the u.s. created

the code of Indian offenses to
criminalize our culture and spiritual
practices such as the Sundance the
giveaway gifts for the bride and feast
and medicine men punishments included
fines hard labor imprisonment
and that held Russians in 1885 the US
Congress continued its assault on tribal
sovereignty by passing the Major Crimes
Act which unilaterally extended US
jurisdiction over major crimes in two
sovereign the quarter territory in 1887
the US Congress approved the general
allotment act to divide communal land of
the Great Sioux Reservation into
individual parcels of privately owned
property assigned to tribal members our
people had no concept of individual
ownership of our mother earth the Indian
was being viewed with the exalting
egotism of American civilization so that
he will say I instead of we and this is
mine instead of this is our two years
later in 1889 in violation of the 1868
Treaty of Fort Laramie the US Congress
passed an act to divide the Great Sioux
Reservation into five separate and
smaller reservations including the Pine
Ridge Reservation the US government
opened the remaining 11 million acres of
food treaty territory for public
purchase including sacred sites and
burial grounds our people used for
thousands of years
having wronged been for centuries we had
better in order to protect our
civilization followed up by one more
wrong and wipe these untamed and
untamable creatures from the face of the
earth by 1890 our Lakota people once

powerful and free were entirely
dependent on the US government the US
